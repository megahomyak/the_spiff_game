        <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>The Spiff Game has rather contrasting visuals that, as I've been told, can supposedly cause eye strain, and while I have no idea if that's actually true, I don't quite wanna risk it, so please, proceed with caution. You might want to lower the contrast of your device's screen if the game will seem too bright</p>
